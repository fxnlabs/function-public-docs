# Function Network: The Future of Decentralized AI

AI is transforming the world‚Äîbut today, it remains **locked behind walled gardens**, controlled by a handful of tech giants. Compute is scarce. Models are proprietary. Access is restricted.

**Function Network is here to change that.**

We envision a future where AI is **open, decentralized, and permissionless**‚Äîwhere **anyone can contribute**, **anyone can access**, and **no one can control** the flow of intelligence.

By **connecting compute providers, gateways, and AI models in a seamless, blockchain-powered network**, we are building the foundation for the **next era of AI**‚Äîone that is truly **global, fair, and unstoppable.**

## üöÄ Roadmap for a Decentralized AI Economy

### **üå± Short-Term (1‚Äì6 Months): Laying the Foundation**

1. **Testnet Launch Ceremony**

   - Deploy the **inaugural testnet ceremony**, featuring a high-performance AI model to showcase network capabilities. (Coming soon...)
   - **Incentivized testing & security bounties**, rewarding early participants for stress-testing, reporting issues, and optimizing performance.

2. **Breaking Barriers to Entry**

   - Open **provider registration**, allowing both consumer-grade and enterprise GPUs to contribute and earn rewards.
   - Enhance the **consumer platform**, improving AI inference access, developer SDKs, and streamlined integration for real-world applications.

3. **AI Compute for Everyone**
   - Seamless **staking & rewards tracking**, providing real-time insights into contributions, earnings, and governance participation.
   - Launch an **intuitive dashboard**, offering compute providers and users an easy way to manage their AI interactions.

### **üîß Medium-Term (6‚Äì12 Months): Unlocking the Ecosystem**

1. **Mainnet Launch Ceremony**

- Deploy the the protocol to **mainnet on base network**, supporting over 40+ open source models.
- Rewards for points holders, and starting the journey of **decentralized user-owned AI**.

2. **Bridging Web3 & AI**
   - Enable **FUNC staking for AI inference**, where users can **prepay for AI access using decentralized pools**.
   - Launch **developer tools and SDKs** to integrate Function-powered AI into **dApps, smart contracts, and open-source applications**.

---

### **üåê Long-Term (12+ Months & Beyond): The Autonomous AI Network**

1. **Decentralizing AI Governance**

   - Give **FUNC holders control** over network parameters like **epoch length, staking requirements, and rewards**.
   - Launch a **transparent proposal system** for **open community decision-making**.

2. **AI as a Public Utility**

   - Build a **decentralized AI model marketplace**, where developers can **upload, share, and monetize their AI models**.
   - Create **functioning inference APIs** that allow **seamless AI access without central intermediaries**.

3. **Privacy-Preserving AI (Zero-Knowledge Intelligence)**

   - Introduce **zk-proofs for AI inference**, allowing **users to run models on private data without exposing it**.
   - Implement **secure multiparty computation (MPC)** for **fully private AI workflows**.

4. **A Self-Regulating AI Network**
   - Implement **dynamic incentive models** where rewards **automatically adjust** based on **demand, compute availability, and participation**.
   - Introduce **autonomous AI model selection**, where the **community decides which models are prioritized**.

### **üèÜ A Future Where AI Belongs to Everyone**

AI is the most powerful technology of our generation‚Äî**but who controls it will define the future.**

We refuse to let AI remain in the hands of a few.

With **Function Network**, we are building an ecosystem where **compute is accessible, AI is open, and intelligence is free.** A world where **anyone can contribute, anyone can access, and no one can control** the future of machine intelligence.

üöÄ Join us in shaping the **new era of AI**‚Äîwhere intelligence is not a service, but a **right.**
