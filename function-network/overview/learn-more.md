## Benefits of Function Network

1. **Decentralized AI Infrastructure**: Democratizes access to AI compute, enabling fair and transparent participation.
2. **Scalable and Flexible**: Dynamically supports multiple models, providers, and gateways for evolving AI workloads.
3. **Fair Reward System**: Checkpoints and performance tracking ensure transparent distribution of FUNC rewards.
<!-- 4. **Community-driven Governance**: FUNC holders help shape the network's future. -->

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized AI Inference**

Function Network enables AI inference tasks to be processed through a decentralized network:

- **AI Models**: Define specific computational workloads (e.g., image recognition, NLP).
- **Providers**: Supply computational power to execute these tasks.
- **Gateways**: Act as the interface between users and the network.

### 2. **Staking and Rewards**

Participants stake FUNC tokens to contribute to the network and earn rewards:

- **Providers**: Stake FUNC to support AI models and earn FUNC based on their contributions.
- **Gateways**: Stake FUNC to act as intermediaries and earn rewards for routing user requests.

### 3. **Transparent Reward Distribution**

Rewards are allocated based on performance metrics:

- **Epoch-based Rewards**: Incentives are distributed periodically at the end of each epoch.
- **Checkpointing**: Tracks historical contributions for accurate reward calculations.

### 4. **Scalable Infrastructure**

The Function Network dynamically scales with demand:

- Providers can support multiple models to maximize their earnings.
- Gateways ensure seamless routing and scalability for users.
