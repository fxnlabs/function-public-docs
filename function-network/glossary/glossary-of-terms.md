- **FUNC Token:** The native utility token of the Function Network, used for staking, rewarding, and facilitating transactions.
- **Provider:** An operator hosting and maintaining AI inference models, offering services through the Function Network.
- **Gateway:** An entity that connects users to providers, aggregating and routing AI inference requests.
- **Epoch:** A fixed time period (in blocks) during which staking, rewards, and network activities are synchronized.
- **Shard:** A unit of work or compute contribution attributed to providers, determining rewards.
- **Stake:** FUNC tokens locked to participate in network operations, either as a provider or gateway.
