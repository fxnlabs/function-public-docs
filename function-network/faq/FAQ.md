## FAQ

#### **General Questions**

1. **What is the Function Network?**

   - A decentralized system for AI inference, connecting gateways to AI providers using FUNC tokens for staking and rewards.

   **‚û°Ô∏è So what? Why does this matter?**

   - Function Network removes reliance on centralized AI providers, making AI inference more **accessible, censorship-resistant, and cost-effective**.

2. **What are FUNC tokens used for?**

   - FUNC tokens are used for **staking by providers and gateways**, distributed as rewards, and may be used for governance in the future.

   **‚û°Ô∏è How does this benefit me?**

   - Whether you're an **AI developer, compute provider, or just using the network**, FUNC rewards participation. Early adopters may also benefit from **airdrops, staking incentives, and governance control.**

3. **What is an epoch, and how does it work?**

   - An epoch is a **fixed time period** (defined by blocks) where **staking, rewards, and network updates** are synchronized.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Why should I care?**

   - Knowing epoch cycles is crucial if you're **staking, providing compute, or expecting rewards**‚Äîit determines **when and how often payouts occur**.

4. **How are rewards calculated?**

   - Rewards are based on **shards (units of work) contributed by providers within an epoch**, distributed **proportionally from the epoch‚Äôs reward pool**.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Can I maximize my rewards?**

   - Yes! Providers with **higher uptime, efficient nodes, and well-optimized compute setups** will earn **more rewards per epoch**.

5. **What is the significance of `minEpochsLocked`?**

   - This is the **minimum number of epochs FUNC tokens must remain staked** before they can be unstaked.

6. **Will there be points or airdrops for early users before on-chain incentives begin?**

   - Yes! Users who participate in **inference requests, providing compute, or staking FUNC** may earn **points** that **could translate to future airdrops, incentives, or governance influence**. Details to come.

#### **Provider Questions**

1. **What is required to register as a provider?**

   - Register with **metadata (typically the node‚Äôs URL), stake FUNC tokens**, and ensure **whitelist approval**.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Why should I become a provider?**

   - If you have idle **GPUs or compute power**, you can **earn rewards** by contributing to AI inference workloads.

2. **What happens if I don‚Äôt claim my rewards?**

   - Rewards remain **claimable indefinitely** but are subject to an epoch delay before becoming available.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Can I lose unclaimed rewards?**

   - No, rewards won‚Äôt disappear, but **claiming them earlier allows for faster reinvestment or staking.**

3. **What is the penalty for being jailed?**

   - Jailed providers **cannot participate in staking or claim rewards** during the jail period.

   **‚û°Ô∏è How do I avoid this?**

   - Maintain **high availability, correct node configurations, and avoid malicious behavior.**

4. **What does the metadata of a provider represent?**

   - Metadata usually contains **the URL where the provider‚Äôs node can be accessed** for inference requests.

#### **Gateway Questions**

1. **How do gateways interact with providers?**

   - Gateways **aggregate client requests and route them** to providers based on **availability and compute needs**.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Why does this matter?**

   - Gateways ensure **efficient AI inference distribution**, optimizing **latency and cost** across multiple providers.

2. **Can gateways unstake immediately?**

   - No, gateways must **initiate a wind-down process**, followed by a **staking delay** before unstaking is possible.

   **‚û°Ô∏è What‚Äôs the risk of unstaking?**

   - There are **burn 'discount' incentives** for being staked longer. Unstaking will reset your current discount tier.

3. **What metadata do gateways need?**

   - Gateways typically store **routing-related metadata**, such as **endpoint URLs and regional availability**.

### **üõ† Additional Questions (Airdrops, Points, and Future Benefits)**

1. **Will there be points? If so, how do points work, and what are they used for?**

   - Before on-chain rewards, Function may institute a points system. Points would represent **engagement and contributions** within the network and **may be redeemable for rewards, governance influence, or airdrops in the future**. Please see our [Terms & Conditions](https://www.function.network/tos.txt) for more details. 

   **‚û°Ô∏è How can I earn points?**

   - Using Function Network may make you eligible for points. Engage with **AI inference**, stake FUNC, provide compute power, or **use Function Chat** to qualify.

2. **What's the difference between Points and rewards?**

- Rewards are on-chain incentives (in the form of FUNC) for performing actions that benefit Function Network.
- Points represent **engagement and contributions** but not necessarily on-chain rewards. Points **may** make you eligible for future on-chain incentives like airdrops.

3. **When will airdrops be distributed?** 

   - If airdrops occur, eligibility criteria and timelines will be posted on our official channels. Please stay tuned to our official channels for details.

   **‚û°Ô∏è Should I participate now?**

   - Yes! Points programs will be designed to reward early users. **Early adopters have the highest chance** of receiving rewards.
