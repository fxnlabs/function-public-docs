## Tokenomics

#### **FUNC Token Utility**

1. **Staking:** FUNC tokens must be staked by providers and gateways to participate in the network.
2. **Rewards:** FUNC tokens are distributed to staked participants based on their contributions to the network.
3. **Governance:** FUNC tokens may be used for proposal voting and treasury management in the future.

#### **Earning Potential**

- Providers and gateways earn FUNC based on the shards (work) they contribute during each epoch.
- **Example:**
  - If the total reward pool for an epoch is 10,000 FUNC and a provider contributes 10% of the shards, they earn 1,000 FUNC.

#### **Economic Design**

1. **Fixed Supply:**
   - FUNC tokens have a fixed supply, with no inflationary mechanisms, ensuring scarcity and value retention. Current total supply: 1,000,000,000 FUNC.
2. **Treasury Management:**
   - FUNC tokens in the treasury are allocated for ecosystem development, community initiatives, and network rewards.
