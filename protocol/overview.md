# Function Network

Function Network is a decentralized infrastructure designed to power AI inference workloads. Function Network democratizes access to AI compute by enabling anyone with computational resources to participate. Gateways facilitate seamless interaction for users, while providers execute computational tasks defined by cutting-edge AI models.

At its core, Function Network utilizes FUNC, a blockchain-based token, to enable staking, governance, and reward distribution, ensuring efficiency and trust within the system. By connecting compute providers, gateways, and AI models, the network creates a scalable, transparent, and incentive-driven ecosystem.

## Benefits of Function Network

1. **Decentralized AI Infrastructure**: Democratizes access to AI compute, enabling fair and transparent participation.
2. **Scalable and Flexible**: Dynamically supports multiple models, providers, and gateways for evolving AI workloads.
3. **Fair Reward System**: Checkpoints and performance tracking ensure transparent distribution of FUNC rewards.
<!-- 4. **Community-driven Governance**: FUNC holders help shape the network's future. -->

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized AI Inference**

Function Network enables AI inference tasks to be processed through a decentralized network:

- **AI Models**: Define specific computational workloads (e.g., image recognition, NLP).
- **Providers**: Supply computational power to execute these tasks.
- **Gateways**: Act as the interface between users and the network.

### 2. **Staking and Rewards**

Participants stake FUNC tokens to contribute to the network and earn rewards:

- **Providers**: Stake FUNC to support AI models and earn FUNC based on their contributions.
- **Gateways**: Stake FUNC to act as intermediaries and earn rewards for routing user requests.

### 3. **Transparent Reward Distribution**

Rewards are allocated based on performance metrics:

- **Epoch-based Rewards**: Incentives are distributed periodically at the end of each epoch.
- **Checkpointing**: Tracks historical contributions for accurate reward calculations.

### 4. **Scalable Infrastructure**

The Function Network dynamically scales with demand:

- Providers can support multiple models to maximize their earnings.
- Gateways ensure seamless routing and scalability for users.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**  
   Providers and gateways register on the network, linking their accounts to specific models or operations.

2. **Staking**  
   Providers and gateways stake FUNC tokens to participate in the network. Staking ensures accountability and incentivizes contributions.

3. **Task Execution**  
   Providers execute tasks defined by AI models, while gateways route requests to the appropriate providers.

4. **Reward Distribution**  
   Rewards are calculated and distributed at the end of each epoch based on contributions and performance.
