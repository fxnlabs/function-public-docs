## How It Works

1. **Registration**  
   Providers and gateways register on the network, linking their accounts to specific models or operations.

2. **Staking**  
   Providers and gateways stake FUNC tokens to participate in the network. Staking ensures accountability and incentivizes contributions.

3. **Task Execution**  
   Providers execute tasks defined by AI models, while gateways route requests to the appropriate providers.

4. **Reward Distribution**  
   Rewards are calculated and distributed at the end of each epoch based on contributions and performance.

## How to Participate

### For Providers

To participate as a provider:

1. **Register** your provider ID and link it to a specific AI model.
2. **Stake FUNC** tokens as required by the model.
3. **Execute Tasks**: Provide computational resources to support AI inference workloads.
4. **Claim Rewards**: Collect FUNC rewards based on your performance.
5. **Unstake**: After meeting the minimum lock period, unstake your FUNC tokens if desired.

### For Gateways

To participate as a gateway:

1. **Register** your gateway ID and add metadata for identification.
2. **Stake FUNC** tokens to activate your gateway.
3. **Facilitate Requests**: Route user requests to the appropriate providers.
4. **Claim Rewards**: Earn FUNC based on your routing and performance.
5. **Unstake**: Deactivate and unstake FUNC tokens when no longer operating.
