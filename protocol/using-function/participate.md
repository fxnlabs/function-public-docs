## How to Participate

### For Providers

To participate as a provider:

1. **Register** your provider ID and link it to a specific AI model.
2. **Stake FUNC** tokens as required by the model.
3. **Execute Tasks**: Provide computational resources to support AI inference workloads.
4. **Claim Rewards**: Collect FUNC rewards based on your performance.
5. **Unstake**: After meeting the minimum lock period, unstake your FUNC tokens if desired.

### For Gateways

To participate as a gateway:

1. **Register** your gateway ID and add metadata for identification.
2. **Stake FUNC** tokens to activate your gateway.
3. **Facilitate Requests**: Route user requests to the appropriate providers.
4. **Claim Rewards**: Earn FUNC based on your routing and performance.
5. **Unstake**: Deactivate and unstake FUNC tokens when no longer operating.

## Core Components

### **FUNC Token**

FUNC is the native utility token of the Function Network. It powers the ecosystem by:

- **Staking**: Required for providers and gateways to participate.
- **Rewards**: Distributed to contributors based on performance.
- **Governance (Roadmap)**: FUNC holders influence decisions about the network's evolution.

### **Providers**

Providers supply computational resources for running AI models. They:

- Stake FUNC to participate.
- Execute AI inference tasks and earn FUNC rewards.
- Support specific models by aligning with their staking and performance requirements.

### **Gateways**

Gateways enable users to interact with the network. They:

- Stake FUNC to operate.
- Route user requests to providers and ensure task execution.
- Earn FUNC for their role in connecting users to the network.

### **Models**

AI models define the computational workloads to be executed on the network. Each model:

- Specifies computational requirements like shards and compute units.
- Requires providers to stake FUNC to support them.

### **Router**

The Router acts as the central management hub, connecting providers, gateways, models, and other core components.

### **Treasury**

The Treasury manages FUNC tokens and ensures accurate reward distribution to providers and gateways.

### **Checkpoints**

Checkpoint contracts track contributions and performance over time:

- **Provider Checkpoints**: Monitor provider activity and shards contributed.
- **Gateway Checkpoints**: Track gateway usage and compute units consumed.
