## **Core Features**

The chatbot UI integrates features such as message threads, history tracking, and conversation flow. These elements ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience, mimicking successful platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity, but with the added benefit of supporting a variety of models.&#x20;

## **Mobile support**

Extending availability to mobile devices broadens the potential user base significantly, tapping into the growing trend of mobile-first applications. Mobile accessibility ensures that Function Networkâ€™s capabilities are within reach of a wider audience.

## **Model Support**

To cater to a wide range of needs right from the start, Function Network will support various models including Qwen 0.5B/1.5B and Llama 3.1 8B/70B/405B. Users can also opt to deploy their own model to Function Network and use it within the chatbot independently or share it to the world.&#x20;

## Closing Statement

By integrating these features and focusing on user accessibility, Function is set to attract a substantial user base, providing them with tools that demonstrate the capabilities of our developer platform.
